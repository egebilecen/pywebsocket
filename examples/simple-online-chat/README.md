This is a simple example of online chat system using websocket server.
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b>
Server side code is very dirty since it is just written very quickly to serve as an example. Your eyes may bleed, you are warned. 
Also this online chat was orginally written for my old websocket library which I wasn't really thinking to make it an usable library since websocket protocol 
was just a thing I was practicing on due to curiosity. But now I have rewritten the library from scratch and decided to share it, I quickly patched the server 
code to match-up with new library.
